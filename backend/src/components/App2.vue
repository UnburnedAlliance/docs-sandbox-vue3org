<p>This vue shows off "Computed Properties", they are like functions but exist in double {} and don't take inputs.</p>
<code>computed: {

  <em>A computed property will only re-evaluate when some of its reactive dependencies have changed. Otherwise the end result is the same.</em><br />
  <button @click="clearGatesComputed">Clear Gates (COMPUTED)</button>
  <p>Why do we need caching? Imagine we have an expensive computed property list, which requires looping through a huge array and doing a lot of computations. Then we may have other computed properties that in turn depend on list. Without caching, we would be executing listâ€™s getter many more times than necessary! In cases where you do not want caching, use a method call instead. Computed properties are by default getter-only. If you attempt to assign a new value to a computed property, you will receive a runtime warning.  In the rare cases where you need a "writable" computed property, you can create one by providing both a getter and a setter:</p>
  <code>
    export default {
  data() {
    return {
      firstName: 'John',
      lastName: 'Doe'
    }
  },
  computed: {
    fullName: {
      // getter
      get() {
        return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
      },
      // setter
      set(newValue) {
        // Note: we are using destructuring assignment syntax here.
        [this.firstName, this.lastName] = newValue.split(' ')
      }
    }
  }
}
  </code>
  <p>Now when you run this.fullName = 'John Doe', the setter will be invoked and this.firstName and this.lastName will be updated accordingly. Think of a computed property as declaratively describing how to derive a value based on other values - its only responsibility should be computing and returning that value. Think of a computed value as a 'snapshot'... you should avoid trying to mutate computed values. Instead, update the source state to update the values of a computed property.</p>
